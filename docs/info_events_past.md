### COSA Workshop at CDISC US Interchange

(22 October 2024 - Phoenix/Scottsdale, US)

**COSA OpenStudyBuilder workshop - Use OpenStudyBuilder to drive EDC setup - a COSA Workshop**

The landscape of system integrations within our industry often poses significant challenges despite the existence of established data exchange standards such as CDASH and ODM as well as the upcoming Biomedical Concepts and USDM, and others. Many tools, however, tend to support only their native formats or a limited selection of standards using custom extensions. This workshop aims to delve into these challenges and explore the vast opportunities available when integrating systems effectively.

The workshop will primarily concentrate on the integration aspects of EDC (Electronic Data Capture) systems with OpenStudyBuilder, which boasts highly accessible interfaces through APIs and/or via ODM.XML file based integrations. Participants will gain insights into what currently would work and identify existing gaps, considering each system coming along with their own operational data model.

We will start by explaining the OpenStudyBuilder vision around the end to end process with the illustration of the OSB Biomedical Concept (OSB BC).

This will illustrate the Library and the Studies areas of the OpenStudyBuilder, and the reason for having every CTs, models and dictionaries connected to the metadata of our studies.

We will here present the CRF module in the Library and explain the specification around the Study level, throught the use of the OSB BC.

**The OpenStudyBuilder as a new Metadata Repository solution**

by Nicolas de Saint Jorre, Novo Nordisk and Katja Glass, Consultant

DMB - Association Francaise de Data Management Biomedical

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open source project for clinical study evaluations. This tool is a
new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end
consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF
design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities, and
public disclosure of study information. Learn how we are building a complete solution based
on a clinical knowledge graph that includes a shared API, a custom web application, and
exploration tools to further analyze the data. We will also share the open source vision
behind the project and how you can help! The OpenStudyBuilder, originally created by Novo
Nordisk, a global healthcare company, uses Neo4j as its database, along with other products
from the Neo4j ecosystem, including NeoDash, Bloom, and the neomodel Python library.
Neo4j's professional services team is also involved in the development and deployment of
the solution.

### CDISC US Interchange

(18-19 October 2023, live event in Falls Church, VA, USA)

**OpenStudyBuilder - an open-source DDF and COSMoS compatible solution **

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk

This presentation will explore the use of OpenStudyBuilder, a Digital Data Flow (DDF) and CDISC Conceptual and Operational Standards Metadata Services (COSMoS) compatible metadata repository (MDR) solution.   

The OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome from the CDISC 360 project and shared as open source under COSA aiming for end-to-end automations from protocol to TLFs. The solution consists of a Study Builder App connected to a Metadata Repository holding data standards and a Study Definition Repository with study specifications. 

OpenStudyBuilder is based on concept-based standards providing a generalized, implementation independent way of defining complex data elements that have multiple relationships and attributes. This presentation will demonstrate how concept-based standards can be used to define the objectives, endpoints, activities, and scheduling of these in the study design - and how this can be applied as structured protocol content and digitalized study specifications.

### Community Meeting (virtual)

(16 October 2023, virtual event)

In this community meeting we discusses about some needs and questions some members had. It was a more technical documentation, where we checked out how it is possible to see the data structure and it was recommended that the structure could also been displayed by using graph tools which is better exchangable than the current visualization.

Additionally we had been talking about the licenses. The only requirement to non-open-source-software in this project is the database - Neo4j. If you want to use the OpenStudyBuilder solution in production, a Neo4j enterprise edition is recommended. Additional questions and the need for documentation is available. We take this task up and will write down a guide or information on our projecthomepage hopefully this year.

A third discussed aspect was authentification. As this is important when you want to use this in other environments and probably also with other systems then Azure, additional documentation is needed. We will document experiences of a community member inclusion a possible solution. As this process is not finished yet, this might take time.

It will also be interesting to see how the different graph models can work together as the OpenStudyBuilder has a strong metadata graph model which might be connected with other local graph systems. This is an open question on how to.

### OpenStudyBuilder Community Meeting (virtual)

(05 May 2023 - 15:00-16:00 CEST, virtual event)

Everyone was invited to join our OpenStudyBuilder community meeting. After a short introduction we answered questions and showed areas people had been interested in. There was a huge interest in the CRF part including CRF related edit checks which could be added in the "Sponsor Extensions". Apart from the fact, that the ODM.XML can be exported, it is also possible to import ODM.XML - ideally you need to check that the codelists match the CDISC CTs, otherwise new sponsor specific codelists might be created. A nice note is that we are looking into the ICH M11 guideline about structured protocols. CDISC is looking into this guideline as well, so hopefully we can collaborate on this as well.

### COSA Biomedical Concept & OpenStudyBuilder Workshop (Copenhagen, Denmark)

(25 April 2023, Copenhagen, 9:00-15:00)

At this workshop we will dive into what Biomedical Concepts (BC) is, and how the can be applied within a MDR data standards repository and a SDR study definitions repository - illustrated within the OpenStudyBuilder (OSB) solution.

We will as well relate to how BC's are defined within COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models. There will be a shared introduction followed by 4 breakout sessions, leading to a shared reflection and discussion on how we can support and bring these initiatives forward. The 4 breakout sessions are currently defined as:

- Breakout 1: Setup BC's in OSB SoA for a new study, run various queries to learn how BC's can be utilised
- Breakout 2: Learn and understand the BC model in OSB versus the COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models
- Breakout 3: Create and curate OSB BC content and mining BC's from existing data sources like SDTM

**Summary:** We could get a good overview about the different initiatives related to Biomedical Concepts, what the differences are and possible ways forward. Specifically the high participation from CDISC and other experts in the BC field enabled excellent introductions, discussions and a fantastic collaborative opportunity. Thanks for all who joined the workshop.

**Vision and demonstration of the OpenStudyBuilder for supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables using concept-based standards**

by Martin Gram and Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables. It includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards. 

This poster will demonstrate the solution by:

- Showing how concept-based standards can be applied to define a study e.g., specifying objectives, endpoints, activities with reference to the study design schedule.
- Defining SDTM trial summary parameters, study arms, elements, epochs, and visit schedules.Creating structured protocol content directly from the repository.
 
OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.

**Talk to us**

Many used the opportunity to talk to us and see a brief demo.

**Concept-based standards in OpenStudyBuilder supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables**

(27th October 2022 - Session 5: Track B - Trial Design - 8:30 - 9:00CT)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables.

The solution includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards as concept based end-to-end standards linked from protocol specification, data collection to submission datasets. This presentation will focus on how we define and apply the concept based data standards.

OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.  

Slides including demonstration pictures are available [here](./presentations/2022-10-27-OpenStudyBuilderWithDemo-CDISC-US-Interchange.pdf){target=_blank}.

**CDISC Open Source Alliance Booth / COSA Booth**

There had be a high interest in demonstration and talks at the COSA booth around the OpenStudyBuilder. The next interchange will also have a booth and a time schedule, so use further chances for live demonstrations and direct talks!

### OpenStudyBuilder Q&A (virtual)

(24 October 2022 - 15:00-16:00 CEST, virtual event)

**Join the open Q&A session to ask and discuss anything about the OpenStudyBuilder**

We provided a quick overview of the OpenStudyBuilder (10') and the most important links - see [slides](./presentations/2022-10-24 OpenStudyBuilder - Q&A.pdf). The tool went live today on 24. October 2022 with the first version of the minimum viable product (MVP) in version 0.1. Then we started discussions around this tool. 

We have been discussing how the OpenStudyBuilder could be used to support also the pre-clinical phases. The SEND terminology is available in the OpenStudyBuilder. The trial summary datasets are very similar, but there is one additional dataset which could then be added at some point in time. The OpenStudyBuilder contains a lot, but many more things can and should be added. The OpenStudyBuilder is looking also for the pre-clinical area very valuable.

The terminologies have been shown during the meeting. A nice feature for terminologies is to view differences from one version to another. To load terminology updates to the system, currently an administrator running python commands is required. This is one functionality which should be enhanced in the future.

There are many things on the road map. Novo Nordisk is currently working on this as this is a missing part. When a decision on the roadmap has been performed by Novo Nordisk, this will be shared with the community as well. Collaborations enable additional priorities, so even though the core road map might priorize some items lower, a functionality might come earlier through collaboration.

The biomedical concept which is used can be browsed through the neo4j browser which is part of the sandbox environment and the local installation is very important and enables FAIR data. This is very powerful as concepts and contents are linked. This allows also later on to link and search specific information. Currently it is not planned to store the data as linked data. But that is likely on the roadmap far away.

We checked some examples for assessments and how there are stored in the OpenStudyBuilder. Also, the Protocol tool which is currently not open-source has been showed. This tool is running as a Word add-in using the APIs to get the required data. The API layer is very powerful as this enables data consumption and provision for any content.

A question about maintenance came up. As this is an open-source project it relies on the community to support general topics and issues. When there is a more detailed need for support, then it is recommended to use vendors commercially. The current contributors are lists and can easily be contacted. The OpenStudyBuilder would also be happy to include additional vendors to provide services around the OpenStudyBuilder. Novo Nordisk has no intention of being a software provider. The idea is to facilitate knowledge sharing and sharing these solutions among pharma companies. Then there could be a network of suppliers that can give you professional services around the use and installation and integrations and validations and so on.

A lot of documentation is available. The community documentation is this page here. Then we do have the repository documentation along with the source code in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Novo-Nordisk/nn-public/openstudybuilder/OpenStudyBuilder-Solution).. And finally, there is the in-build tool documentation which can be access by the local installation the "documentation" area or through the sandbox access where the documentation is available as well.


### PHUSE EMEA Autumn SDE (Copenhagen)

(13 October 2022, live event in Copenhagen)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S, Katja Glass, Consultant and others

**Presentation: OpenStudyBuilder - Open Source MDR**

The OpenStudyBuilder is based on a proof of concept as part of the CDISC 360&deg; project and is aiming to be a Transcelerate Digital Data Flow compliant implementation aiming for an end-to-end process. Metadata driven concept-based standards can ease our processes and tools. This presentation will show how we can benefit from working with connected metadata with the focus for SDTM and ADAM.

The OpenStudyBuilder is built by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with other vendors. It is (going to be) available as open source. This can become a game changer in our industry, as this will allow for full-scale collaborations that not only discuss processes and tools, but also share implementations, creating flexible and generic toolsets! By using standard APIs, e.g. those from the Transcelerate DDF project, a flexible, generic and interoperable tool landscape can be built.  Just like what we are used to from plug and play apps! 

The MDR as the heart, contains all the metadata and core study data information. The API allows many possible up and down stream integrations enabling system and data integrations. This includes the opportunity to create SAS macros or R functions to download information to the evaluation environments or even upload information.

by Katja Glass, Consultant (Community Manager for OpenStudyBuilder)

**OpenStudyBuilder - The Game Changer**

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project run by NovoNordisk with the intention to support the future CDISC and DDF standards. It can become a game changer to enable the next step of collaboration together with common processes and workflows. Only when we share and discuss also tool implementations including supporting processes, we can build a common toolset and processes which we can use throughout our complete industry. This presentation will show a brief description of the OpenStudyBuilder tool and will show how we as industry can make use of it and design additional processes and tools as building blocks supported by a generic design, specific APIs and the will to change.

### GraphConnect 2022

(6-8 June 2022, live event in Austin, TX, USA)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT / EVIDENTIQ)

**Creating a Clinical Knowledge Graph: Pharmaceutical Collaboration With OpenStudyBuilder**

OpenStudyBuilder is an open source project for clinical study evaluations. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities, and public disclosure of study information. Learn how we are building a complete solution based on a clinical knowledge graph that includes a shared API, a custom web application, and exploration tools to further analyze the data. We will also share the open source vision behind the project and how you can help! The OpenStudyBuilder, originally created by NovoNordisk, a global healthcare company, uses Neo4j as its database, along with other products from the Neo4j ecosystem, including NeoDash, Bloom, and the neomodel Python library. Neo4j's professional services team is also involved in the development and deployment of the solution.

**OpenStudyBuilder - "All you wanted to know about <del>Sex</del> Blood Pressure but were afraid to ask?"**

In this presentation we will demo this new OpenStudyBuilder application (in beta mode) starting from a very simple example:
"To demonstrate the superiority of Drug A relative to Drug B on Blood Pressure (BP)". This will lead us into the magic world of Nodes and Relationships to illustrate how this clinical objective can be "translated" into a linked graph, reducing the number of inconsistencies!

This presentation should illustrate how a concrete NEO4J professional application will help Clinical Research to bring a new drug to the market faster. You will see how this Graph database will allow us to produce related and consistent data to improve life on Earth!

### Presentation - Next Generation MDR Solution

**Next Generation MDR Solution for Study Design and Configuration Using Concept-based Standards**

*(15-19 November 2021 - PHUSE EU Connect)*

[Recording](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3434982/5FD81FE1D2CC85B2DA504DBBAF23DDE8){target=_blank} (needs EU Connect 2021 registration), [Slides](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3434982/5FD81FE1D2CC85B2DA504DBBAF23DDE8){target=_blank}

An MDR PoC solution was developed as part of the CDISC 360 project to illustrate how a study specification can be made using the concept-based standards. Concept-based standards are generalised data standard elements which correspond to how objectives, endpoints, activities and assessments are defined and scheduled in the study design. At Novo Nordisk, we are applying the learnings from the CDISC 360 PoC as inspiration to develop our next generation MDR and support the end-to-end process for clinical data standards.

This presentation will demonstrate how these goals can be achieved through a Study Builder App connected to a Study Metadata Repository and its linked graph database. This MDR solution is developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with a few vendors. Our ambition is to share this MDR solution as an open-source project and thereby contribute to improving data standards and tools supporting clinical development.
