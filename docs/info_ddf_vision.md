The OpenStudyBuilder not only serves as Metadata Repository, but also contains study definitions and aligns with the concept of a Study Definition Repository as envisioned by the TransCelerate Digital Data Flow (DDF) project [(DDF)](https://www.transceleratebiopharmainc.com/initiatives/digital-data-flow/){target=_blank}. The objectives and vision of both the OpenStudyBuilder and the DDF project share a striking resemblance. Therefore, the comprehensive overview videos produced by TransCelerate can serve as an excellent resource to gain an understanding of the OpenStudyBuilder's vision
