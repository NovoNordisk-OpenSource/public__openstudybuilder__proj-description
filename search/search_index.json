That is, BCs exist independent of any given standards implementation, such as SDTMIG v3.2 or CDASHIG v2.0.

The \"Activity\" as well as the \"ActivityInstance\" we name \"Body Weight\". </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 10: Body Weight Example Activity Concept</p> <p>In the Study Flowchart we can use this grouping to group and display the corresponding activity. But furthermore, we can use the same information on the CRF by having a form definition \"FormDef\" and an item group definition \"ItemGroupDef\" which is linked to these activities. The \"ActivityItem\"s contain additional detailed information. For this the \"Body Weight\" can either use \"kg\" or \"lb\" as \"UnitDefinition\". Such information can be linked to item definitions \"ItemDef\" required for the CRF design and simply be used. For this the CRF can contain the unit selection as well as an examination date.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 11: Additional Information for Body Weight</p> <p>Additionally, the concepts contain also the SDTM information - \"Body Weight\" belongs to the \"SDTMVariable\" which is \"VSCAT\" using the \"CTTERM\" \"VSCAT = Body measurement\". The same can be done to link the domain and other related information like the content for the SDTM variable \"VSORRES\".  </p> <p>Just by adding links to ADAM, define-xml and any other information, you might be able to envision the automation capabilities of these concepts. Such concepts do not only support data collection, presentation, CDISC standards support, but could be used automate many our processes and beyond. The main disadvantage is the complexity of such concepts, as we still need to be able to work with this.</p> <p>Luckily not everyone needs to understand these concepts. A study designer can still work without knowing the concept behind. With a corresponding implementation and usage behind a concept everyone will benefit from this. For example, a study designer can simply select activities like collection of body weight, height, pulse and more and the CRF designer will automatically see these items on the CRF, and the study analyst can see the SDTM variables which they can expect and much more. If the protocol is updated with a new \"Actitvity\", that could automatically be added as new CRF item and will be dedicated to SDTM variable(s) - if implemented that way. </p>"},{"location":"guide_activity_concept/#openstudybuilder-data-model","title":"OpenStudyBuilder Data Model","text":"<p>The concepts data model is documented in the OpenStudyBuilder public repository and can be browsed to gain a better understanding of these.

This can be used to enforce business logic and domain-oriented views of data. But APIs allow for more controlled operations on the database by enforcing the business logic and providing a more domain-oriented view on the data.

APIs are not only available for the OpenStudyBuilder, but are utilized by many other tools as these make the communication between systems much easier. </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 2: OpenStudyBuilder Conceptual Architecture</p> <p>Let us start on the left side. The CDISC Library expose its data through an API, so this can be used by a program to load relevant data. Other library and dictionary providers might have an API where the data can be loaded from one system to another automatically. For the OpenStudyBuilder we have standard import programs in place which read the data from the CDISC API and stores the data in the database using the OpenStudyBuilder API - there are many parts in the API just responsible for standard imports.</p> <p>On the right side is the OpenStudyBuilder application which is also only communicating with the database through the OpenStudyBuilder API. Other tools like a protocol tool (not open-sourced currently) also access the data needed for their use-cases through the API. Addition use-cases could be, but not limited to, EDC tools which use the API to import and export ODM-XML metadata updates.</p> <p>The OpenStudyBuilder API is very powerful and contains a lot of endpoints to work with the data. Tool integrations are typically very difficult, but will be easier by utilizing APIs. To integrate multiple systems is still challenging, as every tool is using different interfaces. To overcome integration issues, the TransCelerate DDF project is working together with CDISC on API standards. The OpenStudyBuilder has an DDF-API Endpoint available which can be used (see DDF-API Overview). This enables any software supporting the DDF-API standard to be also working with the OpenStudyBuilder.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3: TransCelerate DDF API - Example</p> <p>The potential for an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) tool to support the DDF standards is significant. By connecting just the different solutions, for example by specifying the URL in a configuration file, tools would not need any further integrations when all provide the same information. Currently the capabilities of the DDF API might not be as powerful as required. The native OpenStudyBuilder API provides many additional information which could be consumed.

The study definition data can be referenced in specific versioned study definition instances as well as general references to those. A study definition instance has a specific status. All these terms will be described in this guide.</p> <p>A study definition can at a point in time be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li>Draft and Never Released, the study definition can be edited, deleted, released into minor version, or locked into major version. No persistent study definition instances exist yet.</li> <li>Draft and Released, the study definition can be edited, released into minor version or locked into major version. Persistent study definition instances do exist.</li> <li>Locked and Released, the study definition cannot be edited, it can be unlocked into draft. </li> <li>Deleted, the study definition is deleted and can no longer be edited. Attribute values will no longer be part of uniqueness checks. The deletion is a soft deletion, audit trail still exists, and deleted studies can be listed on a dedicated tab for deleted studies so audit trail can be displayed.</li> </ul> <p>This is all controlled by several actions, bringing the study into different states - illustrated in below state-action diagram and described in the following section.</p> <p></p> Action Description New (Add) A study is created from scratch or as a clone from an existing study. This will bring the study into the state \"Draft and Never Released\". Edit A study can be edited when the study status is in Draft. The editing will not change the state, it will continue to be either \"Draft and Never Released\" or \"Draft and Released\". Release This will create a stable persistent study instance that can be referred to for downstream usage, as a data snapshot reference in the repository.  A concurrent minor version number will automatically be assigned (0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.1, 1.2, ...).  The study will continue to be in 'Draft' status but will change state from \"Draft and Never Released\" to \"Draft and Released\".  Release is like check-in in a document management system or a commit and push in a Git repository. Delete Study can only be deleted if never locked.  When the study is deleted, it will be removed from the list of studies and not take part in e.g., uniqueness checks. But technically it is a soft delete, and the study and audit trail can be seen from the tab listing deleted studies. Lock This will create a versioned stable persistent study instance that can be referred to from downstream usage, as a data snapshot reference in the repository. The study will change status to 'Locked' and can no longer be edited. To continue to edit, an un-lock action must be done starting up a new version.  Vision is to add a related study milestone (e.g., 'Final protocol') and a set of metadata rules and consistency checks must then be fulfilled to lock the study for a specific study milestone. This is however not yet implemented and initially the simple rule we have defined is a study number must be assigned and a study title defined.  A concurrent major version number will automatically be assigned (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ...).  The locking process will also make a study release instance to ensure the latest release instance never is older than the latest locked instance.  Lock and Release is like creating a final approved version in a document management system or a merging a pull request into main in a Git repository. Un-lock This will bring the study back into the 'Draft' status where the study again can be edited. As the study always will implicitly be Released when Locked this will bring the study to the \"Draft and Released\" state. <p>This enables several study definitions instances that can be used for querying study definitions data from OpenStudyBuilder. A study definition instance can have the following status:</p> <ul> <li>Draft, refer to the current instance that can be edited.</li> <li>Released, refer to a minor version of a stable instance (snapshot) for downstream testing and review.</li> <li>Locked, refer to a major version of a stable instance (snapshot) for downstream usage in final deliverables. As this is a major version several constraint checks must be fulfilled for a study definition instance can be locked. Both a locked version instance and a released instance is made when the study is locked to avoid the latest released is older than the latest locked.</li> </ul> <p>Some of these study definition instances are general, and some refer to the specific released minor versions or locked major versions of a study definition instance. Each are described in the following table.</p> Study Definition Instance Description Latest Refer to the latest study definition instance in status Draft when the study is in Draft or the latest Locked instance when the study is Locked. This is used by the OpenStudyBuilder as the default study definition instance when displaying study data. Draft Refer to the current draft study definition instance when the study is in Draft (i.e. it does not exist when the study state is Locked and Released). Note this study instance is not persistent and will change whenever updates are being made to a study definition. Latest Released Refer to the latest released study instance. Released sub-version Refer to a specific released study definition instance done at a specific point in time and assigned a sub version number Latest Locked Refer to the latest locked study definition instance. Locked version Refer to a specific locked study definition instance done at a specific point in time and assigned a main version number. <p>These study definition instances should be used in different ways. For final deliverables (like a final protocol version) a locked version should always be used. For testing e.g., SDTM generation a stable released study definition instance can be used. The benefit here is it is stable so will not have instance changes as the study definition is being updated, this makes it simpler to test and debug the programs using the metadata.</p> <p>For general queries and exploration of study definitions metadata the general lates study definition instance should be used, where you always see the lates metadata independent of status.</p>"},{"location":"guide_overview/","title":"Overview of OpenStudyBuilder Content","text":""},{"location":"guide_overview/#mdr-sdr","title":"MDR &amp; SDR","text":"<p>The OpenStudyBuilder consists of two parts: </p> <ul> <li>A Library of reusable standards  </li> <li>A study metadata definition tool </li> </ul> <p>In the following the library will be named the Clinical Metadata Repository (Clinical MDR) and Study Definition application will be named the Study Definition Repository (SDR).</p>"},{"location":"guide_overview/#standards-library-mdr","title":"Standards library (MDR)","text":"<p>In the OpenStudyBuilder you can manage different types of standards within Clinical MDR.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Controlled Terminologies</p> <ul> <li>Code Lists.

The tool went live today on 24. October 2022 with the first version of the minimum viable product (MVP) in version 0.1. Then we started discussions around this tool. </p> <p>We have been discussing how the OpenStudyBuilder could be used to support also the pre-clinical phases. The SEND terminology is available in the OpenStudyBuilder. The trial summary datasets are very similar, but there is one additional dataset which could then be added at some point in time. The OpenStudyBuilder contains a lot, but many more things can and should be added. The OpenStudyBuilder is looking also for the pre-clinical area very valuable.</p> <p>The terminologies have been shown during the meeting. A nice feature for terminologies is to view differences from one version to another. To load terminology updates to the system, currently an administrator running python commands is required. This is one functionality which should be enhanced in the future.</p> <p>There are many things on the road map. Novo Nordisk is currently working on this as this is a missing part. When a decision on the roadmap has been performed by Novo Nordisk, this will be shared with the community as well. Collaborations enable additional priorities, so even though the core road map might priorize some items lower, a functionality might come earlier through collaboration.</p> <p>The biomedical concept which is used can be browsed through the neo4j browser which is part of the sandbox environment and the local installation is very important and enables FAIR data. This is very powerful as concepts and contents are linked. This allows also later on to link and search specific information. Currently it is not planned to store the data as linked data. But that is likely on the roadmap far away.</p> <p>We checked some examples for assessments and how there are stored in the OpenStudyBuilder. Also, the Protocol tool which is currently not open-source has been showed. This tool is running as a Word add-in using the APIs to get the required data. The API layer is very powerful as this enables data consumption and provision for any content.</p> <p>A question about maintenance came up. As this is an open-source project it relies on the community to support general topics and issues. When there is a more detailed need for support, then it is recommended to use vendors commercially. The current contributors are lists and can easily be contacted. The OpenStudyBuilder would also be happy to include additional vendors to provide services around the OpenStudyBuilder. Novo Nordisk has no intention of being a software provider. The idea is to facilitate knowledge sharing and sharing these solutions among pharma companies. Then there could be a network of suppliers that can give you professional services around the use and installation and integrations and validations and so on.</p> <p>A lot of documentation is available. The community documentation is this page here. Then we do have the repository documentation along with the source code in GitHub. And finally, there is the in-build tool documentation which can be access by the local installation the \"documentation\" area or through the sandbox access where the documentation is available as well.</p>"},{"location":"info_events_past/#phuse-emea-autumn-sde-copenhagen","title":"PHUSE EMEA Autumn SDE (Copenhagen)","text":"<p>(13 October 2022, live event in Copenhagen)</p> <p>by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S, Katja Glass, Consultant and others</p> <p>Presentation: OpenStudyBuilder - Open Source MDR</p> <p>The OpenStudyBuilder is based on a proof of concept as part of the CDISC 360\u00b0 project and is aiming to be a Transcelerate Digital Data Flow compliant implementation aiming for an end-to-end process.

Delve into critical questions such as how to seamlessly integrate with new CDISC CT versions? How to load or create sponsor terminology? What kind of additional attributes can I apply? What would I need additionally? How to use this downstream? How to deal with different versions?</p> <p>Join the corresponding channel in Slack!</p> <p>Status February 2025 </p> <p>A community member focus on the development of a user interface to manage import and export controlled terminologies. These activities are still ongoing and a first version might be available in Q1 2025. The specifications are discussed and communicated in our slack channel.</p> <p>Furthermore, we had a deeper look into the available CT scripts. We identified some challenges where we are planning to solve some of those. One of this are a few discrepancies within different CDISC catalogs. We reported these back to CDISC. The CT needs also some more refactoring, which will happen within the OpenStudyBuilder team in Novo Nordisk. We also see that the upload scripts should ideally be refactored - this is on the to-do list, but needs priorization. </p>"},{"location":"info_osb_hub/#osb-trail-systemengineers","title":"OSB-Trail-SystemEngineers","text":"<p>Kick-off January 2025</p> <p>Our second OpenStudyBuilder trail focuses on the collaboration of system engineers working with OpenStudyBuilder (OSB).

It is recommended to use the enterprise version for productive environments. When you want to test or run the OpenStudyBuilder in a very small scale - you would be able to use the community version. Currently only the data migration scripts will not be working which could be overcome by using a different data migration strategy. You also have to be aware that consisency checks are not available in the community version among other features. Nevertheless, working with the community version is possible and expecting that you validate your output, e.g. in downstraem systems, there is no issue with using the community version.</p> <p>To switch to the community edition, a few updates are required in the docker-compose file and some other files.
